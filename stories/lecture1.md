All right, welcome to the second unit in the course. And what we're going to do here is essentially learn how to, what I call, drive the school bus. I'm going to introduce you to developing with VS Code and Python.

VS Code is an IDE, an integrated development environment, and this is going to allow you to debug your code, edit your code, and work with it. And before we get started, you're going to need to make sure that you have Python installed, VS Code installed, and then there are two extensions that we're going to use. We're is what's going to connect your on Windows, Windows subsystem for Linux. 

You only need this if you're on Windows. If you're on Macintosh, you don't need this. And then you're going to need a, everyone's going to need live server, so they're going to need to, live server, you need this basically, of this. 

You're going to need to install VS Code first, and then the other two extensions. So at this point, what I want to do is, I want to go through the project, and what we're going to do is, I'm going to show you how to clone this, and then use this project to learn how to use VS Code and introduce you to Python, and you're going to base your new project on this repository. So essentially what we're going to do is, we're going to go through all the files and everything about this as we're going through the video, and your job is to recreate this, and you've successfully completed this unit if you have the same program working that I have, and that you should be able to understand how to use the debugging tools, and do the commits, and generally work with it. 

So without further ado, let's get started here. So I already have all this installed and set up. I have Python, I have VS Code, I have WSL and everything. 

So the way I know that I have this is, what I'm going to do is, I'm going to do PowerShell, and if you're on a Mac, you would do Terminal, and what I can do here is type, and this part's only for Windows, and essentially Windows, or Linux, and Macintosh. Macintosh already has Linux essentially built into it, so we're just using WSL to get Windows to be able to have Linux, and then Macintosh users, you pretty much, most of the stuff is already set up for you. All right, so what I did was, I just typed Ubuntu to start the Ubuntu, because I already have WSL set up, and you should have had that in the previous unit, and so what I'm going to do now is, I'm going to do a mkdir projects, and it's going to tell me I already have this directory, because I already have a projects directory, and I don't want it, but that would make a projects directory, and then I'm going to do a cd projects, and I hit the tab key to autocomplete. 

Two tricks with Linux is just the tab key to autocomplete files and folder names, and then the up arrow lets us. At this point, what I'm going to want to do is, and this is how most of the time you're going to want to get my projects set up, and most of the time the projects in the class are all going to be set up the same way. So let's get this project set up. 

I'm going to go to the repo. I'm going to click on SSH. I'm going to clone this. 

I'm going to go over to terminal here. I'll type git clone, and then I paste this, and it's going to copy module 2. Now what I'm going to want to do here is I'm going to cd into model 2, and we have to go and set up a Python virtual environment. So what we're going to do is type python dash m venv space venv, and we use virtual environments to keep our dependencies, the libraries used to make the program, isolated into this project because there's a global Python and then there's your virtual environment Python. 

The virtual environments are per project, and the global is for all the Python installed globally on your computer, and for the most part, we don't want to install anything globally. We want to have everything installed in the virtual on each particular project because different projects would have different libraries, and it's going to prevent problems if you just isolate your dependencies into the project, and unless you really want to have it, and I always misspell that. I thought the Mac might be Python.

I think the Ubuntu is Python. For either one, what you might want to do is just do a Python. If you do a Python or Python 3 dash dash version, you're just looking for a version 3.10 or above, so like I think it comes with Ubuntu, whatever you do install with WS.

All right, so now what I'm going to do is I'm going to, I made the virtual environment, and if what I'm doing here is if I do a list the L, you'll see that it made this VNV folder right here, and that's a local copy of Python for this particular project, and this is where any libraries are used or are installed, and what we're going to need to do is now activate this, so I'm going to do a source venv bin activate, and once I have that, I'm going to do a pip install dash r, hit tab on the requirements, and then this is installed on the PyTest testing framework. I use the metaphor of driving the bus to sort of explain that you have to be able to run git, and then you have to be able to run the IDE. The version control is essentially there for you to collaborate, and to keep track of your work, and to allow you to manage text like a video editor, and we've talked about that in the previous unit, and then Python is your coding, and essentially in this course what you're going to be learning is professional coding practices and processes for object-oriented programming, and to make programs that are reliable, because if essentially if your programs are not reliable, they're not worth having, so my approach to teaching this is to have you model professional processes as much as possible, even if you're new to this. 

I'd rather have you learn it right from the beginning, even if it's a little harder for some people, and then that way you're not learning bad habits. So what we're doing here now is I'm going to type a clear, and I want to test this out, so what I'm going to do is I want to test the program, and this is actually a program, a library called PyTest, and this is the sort of the main Python testing framework that's used to do what we call automated testing, and it's not automated in the sense that the tests are not automatically created, it's just that they're automatically, it's code that checks other code, so like I have test functions, and my test functions call code, call functions that are inside these files, and essentially this report is a called a coverage report, and that the coverage report, it's there so that it will tell you if you have code written that doesn't have an automated test, and we're going to open up VS Code now, so we can take a look at this, so I'm going to do CODE period, and I can just, and here I can see that my, what I'm looking for is that, that's the name of my virtual environment that's active, and I want to see that that's there, and then here you can have PyTest, and then run it, and we're going to go over what these, all these files and folders, because this is basically like the, what I would call the minimally viable product, or minimally viable Python, it has pretty much all the little bells and whistles that you need to have, that would encounter in most Python projects, here is the file explorer, so here you're going to have your github folder, and this is for github actions, and we can take a look at github actions real quick, and essentially github actions is that, like I, when I type that PyTest program, that's testing my code, and this is just doing it on github, so this is the same results that we get whenever we type PyTest on our local, and we have github actions, which is this file right here that basically configured to run the commands that we need in order to test it, and do it locally, so it's like here we did python install upgrade pip, we didn't do that locally, but sort of standard procedure to do, then we would install, and then we run the PyTest, and if this passes, you get 100% coverage, and you have, it'll pass, okay, I'm going to make sure that we have the extension, so I'm going to go here, and I would be like WSL, so I just make sure that we have this extension, and then if I do live server, we'd make sure we have this, okay, so that's what the github folder is, and you can pretty much for the most, like this file will change periodically throughout the course, but this pretty much a standard file that you have that is just sort of, this is called a YML file or YAML file, and this is just a data format that we use to put configuration information, and we use it a lot of times, we use these YML files to automate processes like what we're doing, like job, test, runs on Ubuntu, then each step, check the code out, set up Python, install the dependencies, run the test, and so this is just automating what we are doing manually, so that whenever we push to github, that this is actually going to work, and our branches here is called main, and then we have pytest, and then we're down here, we have VS code, and you don't really need to do anything, because I set these up for you, but you're going to want to copy these from one project to another, because I created these for Python to run these projects nicely, okay, and here's the settings, okay, so these are just VS code specific settings that are here, the app folder contains the program, and let's just take a look at how this program runs, we're going to look at that in a minute, this is the coverage report, which is pretty cool, and what this does is, if I right click on here, and then if we have a live server called, what I'll do is, I'll go to localhost 5500, that's the server port, and then I just go to the coverage report, and this will show your code, and if you're missing tests, like so for example, I'm going to disable my automated test, which we'll look at, but like here's my calculator test, so this is testing whether or not my calculator is properly working, forgot to run the calculator, so we run the test, we didn't run them, if I have this, and then I run PyTest, it's going to come back and tell us that we are missing 10 lines essentially of code that need to run, that need to be tested, so I think it's like, then it drops us to five percent, so it drops us five percent, and then if we would go over to the live server, it's going to show us that the addition function, this addition area, this doesn't have testing, before if we have run this, and like what I'm doing here to highlight this, I highlight it, and I go ctrl forward slash, ctrl forward slash to toggle this, and so I'm going to toggle it back, and then if I run PyTest, and that would go away, so the addition is now functional, but I mean now has the test. A lot of what this course is about is how to write reliable computer programs with automated testing, and the reason why I do this is because if you're going to write programs, they need to work, and if you're going to progress as a developer, really the difference between amateur hobby developers and professional developers that get paid is that professional developers make programs that work, and learning how to write automated tests allows you to ensure that your program works, it works reliably after changes, it allows you to have essentially, imagine that you're trying to drive a race car, and the tests provide the guardrails to make sure that your project doesn't drive off a cliff, because if you don't have these automated tests, you're going to start to learn as you do the course that the programs end up doing many different processes, and that those processes, even one change can break things that you didn't even know it would break, you may change one thing in something to fix something, and then that one change that fixes your thing breaks somebody else's, so we actually have to have automated tests to make sure that whatever code we write isn't driving the project off of the cliff, that it isn't going to break the overall functionality of the program, so let's take a look at the functionality of this program, so we've been running the test, but we're going to actually run it, I'll do a clear here, and this is just a simple python3 main.py, and it says welcome to the calculator REPL, and so what is REPL, it's just an acronym for what type of program this is, it's a read evaluate print loop, this is how we keep a server running essentially, we're just reading data from the user, we're evaluating it, and then we're providing output to print it, and then we're looping it, and you'll see this as we whenever we go through the code, and so this program, if I type in add one space one, it's going to do result two, if I type in subtract one one, if I do divide, if I do multiply one two, and if I do a divide one one, or if I do a divide one forward slot, divide one zero, and then it's going to say division of zero is not allowed, and then our program to get out of it, we type in exit, so this is pretty much the simplest program that I could provide to you that had user interactivity, and it performs some basic math functions, and the reason why we work on the calculator is because we're not learning to write fancy code, in a sense to do all sorts of like bells and whistles, as far as what it looks like as a user interface, what we're trying to do is learn to write very reliable, testable, and industry standard coding practices that developers that work for top companies follow to write the most important applications that those companies rely on to make money, okay, so we're in the business of development, and we can't sell bad products, just like would you go to walmart if every time you went to walmart you bought something, and it broke, so if you were a why would somebody pay you to do that job, if every time you wrote a program it broke, so they're not, so you as a developer, and as a programmer, you want to make sure that whatever code you're writing is actually going to work, and that's your number one priority, it's not how fast you write it, I'd rather have somebody take a while to get something done, but that it had testing, and it had everything that it needed to have in order for it to work properly, okay, now what we're going to do now is look at different ways that we can run the program, and then we'll see the actual how the program runs, so here if I go to, if I do run, I can do a run without debugging off the menu, and then this, I'm going to type exit, sorry, didn't get to this, so I can run it off of here without debugging, and this just runs it the normal way, like if we were on the terminal, but what we can do now is we're going to actually run it with what's called debugging on, and these are break points, these stop the execution of the program, so what I'm going to want to do now is I'm going to want to do a go terminal, right, go, and then I'm going to want to run this with starting the debugger, and I turn break points off and on, once the program started, I can't add new break points, and I just click next to the line to add the red dot to add it, and then once we do this, we get some controls, and this is sort of like our video controller for how we're playing the program, and we could go to continue, and click, and we would hit every break point, and then at this point it's going to add one, one, and then we would get results, we don't have any more break points, and we want to stop the execution of the program, so let's go and see how this program runs from start to finish using the break point, right, so what I'm going to do here is I'm going to go to, I'm going to go over to here, run and debug, go, start debugging, and the starting of the debugging is what allows us to engage the break point, so what happens here is that we've hit a break point, and then in order to keep, we have a couple controls, we have step over, so this is basically how to go to the next line, and then what we're going to do is we see this calculator is actually our function that we're going to call, and a function is just a group of code that we call, okay, we'll learn a lot more about functions and everything, we're really just trying to learn how to run this, and get familiar with the editor, and the debugging, and eventually you're going to set a project up like this, and I'll show you a quick way to get that done, so here I don't want to step over, because it would just end the program, it would just, if I do a step over, we're not going to go into the program, so what we want to do is I would have to do an add one, one, and it, we would be running the program, but we're not going to hit any more break point, because we're inside the program, so I'm going to do an exit, and then what I'm going to do here is start debugging again, so I'm going to start debugging, and I'm going to step over, over, but this time I'm going to step into the calculator, and if I step into it, I'm going to go into the function, and then we can go back to like stepping over, and so here is our repel, read, evaluate, print loop, so we're in a while loop, we say while this is true, so this is like an infinite loop, just keeps running this code, and in Python, we use tabs to control flow, so the spacing is important, you know, there's indentations like this, and you see the lines in the if statements, this is controlling the execution, so everything within here is being executed in the loop, and what I can do is just keep clicking step over, and then this point, it's going to ask me to do an add one, one, and we can hover over, there's a few ways we can do this, we can hover over variables, I can remove this watch, but I can take a user input, and I can do add watch, so whenever I'm running this program, I would have this to view what's inside this variable, so like basically what this is doing is giving you like x-ray vision into the execution of the program, so you can see how it works as we're developing it, so what we have is we get the user input, that's what I typed in, add one, one, then we have add one, one, and I'm calling this method, this is a method on the string type, and this is just lower casing this, so that the user, if they type the capital EXIT or whatever, it's going to convert it to lower case, so that we're, what we call sanitizing the user input, we're getting the user input into a standardized format, so that we can program with it, so the user input, if they typed exit, then that would break, and we would print, print, or exit the calculator, they didn't do this, so we're going to skip that, then we go to a try, and basically what happens is, is that we try to perform an operation, and then if it wasn't an operation that we supported, then it's going to say invalid input, but we have valid input, so what's going to happen is, we're going to go down and have add one, one, and then with add one, one is the user input, and then this split method, so when you see a period, and I do period split, this is a method, so Python's object-oriented by default, like everything is an object, and when we call a method, and that's a function on a object, or an instance, or whatever you want to call it, so a method is a function on a class, and so we have a class called string, which is our data type, and then this is the split, so what split does is, it just breaks the text apart, so it basically creates what's called a list, so actually the string is a list, and then it's splitting the string into separate values, so here we have an operation, a num, a num2, so if we go and skip, go to the continue, we would be able to see that operation has add, number one has one, and number two has the other value, we can see what they are here, but we only have a watch on user input, and then what would happen is, I'm going to go to the next stage, and then the add, I check it, that it's like operation equals add, and so this is the operation that I'm going to execute, now this is going to call this, now I want to go into the addition function to see how this works, so now we're going to actually...
