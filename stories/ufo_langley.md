all right vs I have a brand new UFO video for you let's dive in all right so here's a few details about this video now this was taken in Virginia specifically right next to Langley Air Force Base now why is that important because apparently recently there have been swarms of drones or UFOs flying around and over this Air Force basee protected airspace right and that we don't know how to stop it and we don't know what it is and this is a perfect example this video that was just taken okay this week um of this phenomena right so in this video I'm going to play part of that UFO video and then kind of you know dive into the story right so first let me play the video so you can just get that cuz maybe that's all you're here for right let's play the UFO video and then we'll dig in further they started off down there they've just been chilling there there's like blue there's like a blue light there's a white light there red lights green lights a string ofing Christmas tree lights but it's at an angle wild over Plum Tree The Bays over there we're out here fishing Sunday October 10 uh 13th 900 p.m. now that is an interesting video right different colored lights um kind of looks like Christmas tree lights of some sort right um and again just taken this recently right and specifically this video was taken right here right and you can also see on the map how close this is to Langley Virginia now the gentleman's name who uploaded this is Matt whan and I'll put a link in the description so you can go watch the full UFO video on his YouTube channel now I did see this post originally on Reddit that's how I got to it so I'll put a link to that too if you want to go check out U that post and maybe get some more details in some cases mother ships have been reported according to melon who also managed security and information operations for part of his time at the Pentagon these mother ships melon clarified were extremely fast larger vehicles that have been observed collecting or releasing swarm of smaller craft uh what they're talking about Christopher melon right here right who definitely might know what he's talking about and then as an example they said this one such Mothership case was investigated by Federal Aviation Administration the FAA special agent Michael bumberger over Nebraska government record show local sheriffs reported seeing 30 to 50 unusual craft flying independently of one another with the larger quote Mother Ship hovering nearby for hours uh I don't know about you but this is fascinating right talking about now there's these motherships right that are releasing these smaller quote unquote drones or UFOs or what we don't know what they are right that is fascinating a Mothership could this be a non-human intelligence Mothership an alien Mothership that's insane right and fascinating and another thing that's fascinating in this article if you remember from that UFO video you could see these different colored lights like the gentleman explained it's like blue there's like a blue light there's a white light there are red lights green lights well check out this official government document right received because of a foyer request Freedom of Information Act look what one military witness had to say about some drones or UFOs over Langley a military witness tested t ifies to the drones displaying flashing red green and white lights this testimony was released via the US Freedom of Information Act along with 50 pages of Air Force records on the December wave of drone swarms over Langley yeah so that happened uh I have to admit that is super strange right why are we seeing all of these right and the military is admitting to it not having control of our Coastal airspace and our coastlines that's not good especially next to our most sensitive parts of America right Washington DC is right there Virginia Norfolk Langley like these are not just any installation so this is quite concerning if I'm being honest right so I don't know it's I'm I'm baffled to be honest with you so there's way more reports there's way more sightings it's not like it's just one isol at ated incident right and if you're on Reddit you start to see you know people posting I mean it's hard to tell if they're telling the truth right but just tons of people posting that they've seen similar things either near that area or where they live right which could help explain it's not just something there right it's something happening everywhere right which is what people think right this phenomena right it's not just these drones right Chinese or Russian drones it's something more potentially right which would make sense CU otherwise what our adversaries just have drones everywhere that also seems unlikely right so I don't know but look let's go out playing that UFO video one last time they started off down there they've just been chilling there here's like blue there's like a blue light there's a white light there are red lights green lights a string of Christmas tree lights but it's at an angle so wild over Plum Tree the bay over there we're out here fishing Sunday October 10 uh 13th 9:00 p.m. all right
