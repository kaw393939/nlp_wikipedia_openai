do you want to see a UFO flying out of the water I've got the video for you let's dive in now the video I'm about to show you is from May 28th 2022 around 1 p.m. at Miami Beach it was during an air show that's right different planes flying around showing off and then this one guy David Sugarman that's his name yo hey yo what we got today a special guest is in the mother building Dave sugar what's up whaty what's up what's up he captured an amazing video that I'm going to show you and we're going to break it down this is what you might consider a Uso right an unidentified submerged object a UFO coming out of the water footage of that is really hard to get in fact I that just really aren't any right or going into the water all right so let's watch the clip uninterrupted and then we'll break it down did you see it it's kind of hard to see right I tell you what let's slow the video down and take a close closer look so in this slowdown version which I played a few times right you can see clearly that something is just flying up right there at a pretty fast rate now just out of frame is it you know quote unquote coming out of the water but there's nowhere else for it to have been which is there in the water or on the water right um but you can clearly see that it is in front of the Horizon so it's not something far away right take a look at this so that does make it a little more interesting right um it's clearly coming from either the top of the water or In The Water Somewhere there right and just flying out I mean it's literally just out of frame there the origin but you can tell that it is in front of the Horizon now let's take a closer look at the footage as it's being tracked so you can kind of see the trajectory all right now I put a link in the description so you can go watch um the original video uh shout out to UAP tracker for doing this let's take a look all right so the way it tracks is pretty interesting right it's not this straight line it's just zigzagged or jaged right like it's just it's not a straight line basically zigzag is not the right word um but it's definitely off right and that's interesting I don't know why right uh it has a weird trory and it does kind of pick up speed as it goes up uh which is also interesting so curious to read you know what y'all say in the comments for sure about this now David Sugarman went on a show and talked about this specific incident right that he had here's a clip of that crystal clear out the water was flat I was filming the jet because I have a infatuation for military aircraft it's something I've been interested in since I was a little boy I noticed the object when I went home and was reviewing the videos it's unidentified aerial phenomenon coming directly out of the water my reaction I was absolutely absolutely shocked at what I had seen it's clear as day that something is going on it's pretty wild when you when you think about it the fastest aircraft showcased of this event travels at more than 1,500 mph the speed of the UFO appears to far exceed that my reaction to the speed of the object was I was I was shocked I didn't have an answer even more remarkable the object appears to achieve this speed straight out of the ocean so there you go you have it there from David Sugarman right now I'll put links in the description to everything you can go to David's Twitter page and see the original videos I've got the other links in the description um as well so what do we think of this object right here right like it's pretty fascinating right I don't know is this a bird um I don't know right it's really interesting and one last thing uh as we head out here I'm going to play the clip one more time the original clip that's not slowed down pay attention to just everyone in the water notice how no one reacts right that's kind of interesting why is nobody reacting and pointing oh this thing just flew out there's people right next to where this thing flies out of the water and I do see that as a red flag but you know who knows I don't know so take a look all right y' hope youall enjoyed today's video this was awesome to look out I want to give a shout out to one of our vets Marcus who sent this to me and was like you got to look at this this is amazing check this out no one's seen it I agree not many people have seen this video you've probably never seen this video so let me know what you think in the comments shout out to all the veters sending me stuff for great video ideas if you have one join our Discord and post it all right y'all we'll see you guys on tomorrow's video remember everyday is a gift y'all hey I live inside my own world of M kids screaming in the crad profanities I see the Earth through ice covered in in and Bri cross all the ones who let my cries and watch me weep
