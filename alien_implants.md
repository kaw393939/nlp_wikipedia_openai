this is the story of an implant a supposed alien implant after a UAP encounter that's right someone encountered a UFO and walked away with something implanted in them by allegedly these aliens I've got the story for you let's jump in now before we begin this story let me explain that I have exclusive footage three exclusive Clips today to show you about this alleged alien implant okay one is going to be an interview with the actual person never heard before it look like a diamond effect on the exay film when you look at it and I told the doctor you know when the EDR he said it's something in there and if just bothering you we need to go in and get out I said well whatever you get that's in there I want he made sure I got it back and an interview with Dr Gary Nolan Stanford Professor who allegedly had a look at these implants to be honest there's plenty of other acclaimed implants that at some point it might be worth taking a look at and lastly a video of this implant being tested for its magnetic capabilities to check it to see if it the implant is magnetic again three Clips never been shown before except on vetted in an interview I did with Ron James not too long ago but for some reason it just people haven't noticed this so I wanted to make this video to sort of highlight this exclusive footage because Lando has spoken about said implant and said that he can't talk about who the person is well I can so here is a clip of Luis Alando on news Nation talking about this specific implant this is possibly an alien implant well if you look there's actually a piece of the chip sticking out and what appears to be these fibers that were moving on their own um and then it looks like this this chip or whatever this is this foreign object is encapsulated by some sort of biological material and then most recently I saw Luis Alando talk about this implant in his Jesse Michael's interview I'll put a link in the description please go check out the full interview here's a clip you you handled a an implant uh and it was it was uh the department of of Affairs uh gave you this implant that's you describe it as these fibers these spindly fibers and then you sort of you you you get those away from the thing it's this like microchip is that right or so it's let me give you the best explanation I can imagine a little square piece of metal MH that was iridescent meaning different colors purples and Silvers and different colors that was inomed in a soft gelatinous what appeared to be human soft tissue if you were to remove a tissue sample from somebody maybe about this big and inside there was a a foreign object that was metallic appeared to be metallic and and multicolor and on the biological material this encap ation these fibers multicolored fibers yellows greens blues that came off of that that Central piece of gooey Mass um and according to the pathologist it was moving under the microscope under its own metabolism wow yeah and it was removed by a surgeon from the Department of Veterans Affairs from a US veteran who claimed to have a up close and personal contact with the UAP wow occupants or just U uh I don't know about that particular case and I have to be very careful if there's an implant Hippa and patient conf confidentiality um where do we have any sense of where that implant is or we have an idea okay now let's hear from the man himself okay the person who actually had this implant right now again I've only shown this it's only shown should say in my interview with Ron James but I am bringing uh the clip here in this video so without further Ado let's hear from this unnamed person for the moment um talking about the experience that led to the implant and then I'll share the rest of uh the interview where he talks about the implant but again this is just the incident with the UFO um that led again to this implant so here you go you know you turned over uh a specimen to muon um some time ago and what actually happened with that specimen is that um it was turned over to ttsa and Lou alzando um and then it went to Stanford University where Gary Nolan actually um uh declined to um study it and then it found its way back to you and in between we had the whole uh situation with the muon labs where they did some analysis on it as well and so blue alon's new book imminent has come out muon was working with to the Stars Academy in the very beginning and we uh after our initial analysis of that implant it was given to Lou alzando Who then took it to Stanford University to have Dr Gary Nolan study it um there was a problem with the paperwork and so Gary Nolan declined to to study it so Gary Nolan declined to study it for a variety of reasons um and then it was returned to Lou alzando and ultimately returned to you correct so the uh story about your uh about this uh thing is it's it's out there but you know nobody knows that it's you and certainly we're not going to tell anybody because it's a you know that's your privacy um but to to be Mr James to be honest with you I frankly don't give a damn what anybody thinks because I know what I went through and I know what I seen um people that you know this topic that you we're talking about it's time that the truth come out because from what my research has been oh my lifetime somebody's lying oh well you know there's a lot of people lying and it was a clear night I'll never forget the incident up to certain point that in my mind go blank but uh we were head it back and uh so he's he said man I got this this new headset of night the night goggles so I said really I said I never tried one of them can I Tred so he he slowed down he was out in the middle of nowhere so was no traffic he kind of pulled on the side of the road and he got me hooked up and I got them on my girlfriend was sleeping in the back well we got back on the road and so I'm I'm riding with these night vision goles on and I turn to my right I'm a passenger in the front seat I turn to my right and I see all these orbs these lights and it it the the one that I it caught my attention was pretty good size from when it got up on us it looked like a top hat but it was saer shave was like a Top Hat part of it on top of it and he had some goggles night vision goggles himself and we pulled over the side of the road cuz I'm said he's driving I'm sitting here looking at it as we drive and I said man you look look you see these lights and he'd look over and once while finally I just told him I said man pull over you got to look at this so he did me him both got out of the car walk on the shoulder of the road and my girlfriend woke up and she thought we just got to you know stop take a piss and so she was laid back down well this UFO if you want to call it that it was probably a quarter mile off from from the highway like was right next to nesting up against the side of a mountains that we were going traveling against and it just said it was just sitting there with us and by that time he we said man let's go and so we got back in the car to head back to Riverside and my memory the next thing I know it's the next morning now let's get to the part where this gentleman talks about the implant itself right um and again he had it x-rayed he had it removed it stayed in his body for 30 to 40 years before he decided to have this implant removed right and just to show you that this is the same implant right which I can't confirm here's a picture of both the images side by side the one that Luis alzando shows and the one that is shown um from muon and Ron James right you can clear really see this is the same implant and I can confirm and Ron Ron can too this is the same guy right so uh and I'll explain at the end of the video why exactly Ron can talk about this right but here is the gentleman talking about the implant having it removed x-rayed the whole thing here you go it it was just kind of puffy and soft like a like a bum and I thought it was a like a abess or something of that nature and I thought it would come to a head and bust eventually but it never did and then I got the job at BO in Seattle so when I got to Seattle I had tray again and nothing showed up again well after B in I finally came home back here to Oklahoma and it finally that that looked at it both times told me if it wouldn't so it wouldn't bother me don't worry about it I thought it just a absess well um I let it go I let it go it bet at least 30 40 years for I it started bothering me and I started getting X-rays of it well finally when I got back to Oklahoma I went to VA and it came up for some reason it came up on their x-ray I mean it came up it looked like a diamond effect on the X-ray film when you look at it and I told the doctor you know when the air trading said there something in there and if it's bother you we need to go in and get out I said well whatever you get it's in there I want it he made sure I got it back and so you know you got to collaborate with the VA on that procedure he did say something it was some unusual procedures in uh the course of him taking it out he didn't get into detail about now remember I've got two more clips for you the next one is going to be Dr Gary Nolan talking about this implant again this footage was never seen before okay it was outtakes basically deleted scenes from Ron James's documentary the AC acal truth right that's why the green screen is behind it and everything you'll see what I'm talking about so anyway let's play the clip Dr Gary Nolan talking about this implant and why he didn't study it all right here we go uh Ron James talking to Dr Gary Nolan Stanford Professor um footage not included in the first accidental truth again about this implant here we go right back when ttsa first started and they were making uh some making some statements about having some materials we had a metallic biological sample muon that was an supposed implant removed from somebody we took this thing and we preserved it properly in laboratory conditions and we gave it to L alzando now the word was that it made it to Stanford which may have been you the material did come to me um and I returned it as is you know when you're talking about taking something out of somebody's body uh it needs pathology review first right it needs to go to pathologist to make sure that it wasn't cancer so I mean my statement back to them was I'm sending you this back tomorrow uh I just got it today uh because I don't have a consent form you want me to do stuff on it but if it hasn't gone through I see no pathologist's review here I will lose my job if I touch this stuff it was stated in what got back to muon that there were certain legal ramifications about the that sample and and you know of course A lot of people are just conspiracy minded they're like oh well they just destroyed it so it couldn't be properly analyzed no there's plenty of other there's to be honest there's plenty of other claimed implants that at some point it might be worth taking a look at Roger Le stuff only once I see that they is you know evidence of consent um even if the person is deceased you still have to have evidence of consent from the family right uh so um you know it's just it's just following protocol I really appreciate you clearing that up there's still people that think it was some big conspiracy and I'm like I'm going to I'm going to find out you can't just take pieces of people and send it around by FedEx it's it's also important to dispel conspiracy when you oh I can say this and there's still people are going to say I'm lying and now here is the footage of the implant actually being tested for magnetic properties now take that as you will right is that the proper test what more test should they do I don't know that that's not what I'm here for I'm here to just show you this implant in action you can see in video there doesn't exist another video out there of this implant again the same one Luis alzando is talking about the same one he is saying he can't give any more information well in this video you're getting all of the information you're hearing from the gentleman himself an exclusive footage uh thanks to muon and Ron James and you're also getting exclusive footage of Dr Gary Nolan talking about the implant and now here is the exclusive footage of the implant being tested for magnetic properties to check it to see if it the implant is magnetic I'm using plastic forup so the only metals here will be on the magnet and the implant it sticks to it it won't come off unless I really pull it off it is definitely magnetic now you're probably wondering why can you show this Patrick why why can't why is it that Lou can't talk about it but you can well that's because Ron James brought it exclusively to vetted right and he's got it a full interview with that gentleman coming out in this new documentary The Accidental truth next right um a followup to The Accidental truth right which is where that Gary Nolan footage came from but that's why he's able to talk with it he's he's talking directly with you know the implante E if you will right that's why and that guy gave his okay for it to be talked about right so that's why that's why Alando can't talk about it but we can here um thanks to Ron James and mu on you know say what you want you know you can make up your own mind from this but at least there's something here to look at and to study to think about right more than just a story let's hear from the implante himself right so let me know what you guys think in the comments hope you enjoyed today's video we'll see you guys next time remember every day is a gift y'all peace I live inside my own world of Make Believe kids screaming in the crad profanities I see the world through ice covered in in and Bri cross out the ones who H My Cries and watched me weep
