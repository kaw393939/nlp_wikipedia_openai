let's get to the UFO update major new report from journalist Michael shellenberger let's put this up there on the screen everybody stick with me the details are important so new government whistleblower reveals for the first time the quote the name of an unacknowledged special Access program for the unidentified anomalous phenomenon otherwise known as UAP so the name of that program is immaculate constellation why does this matter the name of the report uh named in the report by this alleged government whistleblower is specifically the name of the program for quote unquote UFO retrieval that was launched after 2017 now to be clear the Pentagon is denying the existence of said program uh the Pentagon said that they have no record of any program known as Immaculate constellation I will get to in a second why that matters and specifically why it is total but the reason why if you look at the overall existence of This Is It Centers on Congress so people will remember that I was at that UFO hearing which was led by multiple members of Congress you had the testimony of Dave grush who was the UFO whistleblower about the existence of these programs that he had seen and had got and pushed through the Inspector General well since then what has since happened is more ramping up Crystal within Congress of questions specifically around the grush allegations the dod uh and the inspector General's report now what they have found is basically blocking at every turn and this is from the congressmen themselves uh I believe that they are trying to get another hearing in the works but the point is is that this report and others like it from grush are giving Congressional investigators and members of Congress the ability to try and to search for very specific types of things through Foya through records requests and by having names and others it's very important to be able to dig the historical analogy I would use is the only reason that we ever learned about many of the shenan that the CIA and the FBI were up to um under the church committee was specifically because some and I'm not advocating this but it wouldn't be the worst thing if it happened is some people broke into a FBI facility and they stole these documents from them we had the names from these CIA programs uh like what happened with the Black Panthers like the LSD experiments and all this stuff and thus the church committee and members of uh the press and others were able to use Foya to actually go and to look for what all that was if that had not happened there is no church committee and there's no Revelation about what happened that's why the name of this program matters a lot so yeah so uh Ken klippenstein has talked to me about this before because he does a lot of foyer requests and by the way it's also obnoxious like you have to have a lawyer it's not something that an ordinary citizen or even an ordinary journalist without like a legal backing behind them can engage in because they'll just completely Stonewall you but part of the key of a successful Foya request is you have to be able to ask very specifically for what you want and so if you don't know the name of the program you'll be fishing around and they can just say no does don't have anything that meets that and so that's why knowing the name of the program so that you can actually make an effective foyer request that they are legally obligated to fulfill in some manner after some period of like fighting you in court and whatever that's why this is important could take a decade yeah so I want everybody to understand this this not all going to come out like immediately Michael actually was on The Joe Rogan podcast just yesterday he broke some of this down let's take a list of it in that report they claim that there is a that the Pentagon is illegally withholding information from Congress about a secret UAP program and that secret UAP program is considered a parent program of other of other programs but it's called Immaculate constellation I was told by a I was I had it confirmed by a second source that this is the name I also was told that if we revealed the name that we would probably fall get under surveillance if I wanted to spread misinformation or disinformation if I was an intelligence agent I think I would get someone to be a whistleblower I would sanction whistleblowers I would I would tell them go on podcasts go on radio shows go on television and discuss all these different disclosures and you can't tell them everything the top secret stuff you know some some stuff you got to keep secret boy I wish I could tell you but there's more I can't tell you there's a lot going on and that's a really good way I would think if I was in control of a narrative that I I wanted to be continuously slippery like this is a very slippery conversation like they you never get to the end of it and what would be the motivation because there's some sort of a program that that exists that they want to hide and the best way to hide it is to uh continually bring up and then debunk these fake programs I'm I'm comfortable saying I'm like 90 95% that the government is hiding information okay so and the reason I'm reason I'm so confident of that is because Donald Trump said so multiple times that they're hiding information um and I S him in the article they probably told him that and also they lied to him about a bunch of stuff didn't even tell him about Chinese drones cuz they worried he was going to shoot him down so they told him something that he says has not been made public to the American people so so if that's um so my view is look if you think it's it's either a secret weapons program that it's a government disinformation program that it's just miss sightings then I want the government I want they they have an obligation to tell us yeah so that it's a good push back but anyway I'll get to uh a little bit now remember when I said that they had no record of the Immaculate constellation that's what the dod is claiming get this so when Dave grush came came forward in 2023 and this Google Trend should not exist it just so happened that there was a massive Spike of people searching Immaculate constellation right next to wri Patterson Air Force Base in Dayton Ohio so again this is a term which nobody knows nobody's out there searching Immaculate constellation what they were worried about was that the name of that program had been leaked under grush and they were searching those people around that area for the name Immaculate constellation who it so suddenly and shockingly appears there in Dayton Ohio so I think that's evidence there of something going on for why were why were so many people right around this air for base just searching for this miraculously especially a base that's well known within that I think what this does is it gives us a quiver into something uh to actually for Congress to begin looking into and that's and part of the problem and I understand I guess where Joe is coming from but he needs to understand like what pressure uh that grush himself is already under I mean the guy life is being investigated to high Hell by the US government basically lost his job there is no incentive for a lot of these people to come out additionally sure yeah there's a lot of incentive to not come out the incentive yeah they're destroying him I mean remember they leaked that whole thing about his PTSD incident uh and all that like he has talked about having threats to his life I don't know if it's true or not but that's what he says uh but in general like his career has not gone well as a result of it it's not like it has been good for his personal life additionally I think what it says is uh it somebody was explaining this to me was that previously one of the reasons that that UFO legislation had gone down the US UAP disclosure Act was so pressured by the intelligence Community was specifically to stop them from the ability to uncover the very special Access program that exists like right here and now for everybody out there I get it everyone keep saying oh it's coming it's coming it's coming Etc I I totally understand but you have to remember what the I mean we just had Jefferson Morley on about JFK it's been 60 years and we still don't know um you know if you think about it there were all these conspiracy theories in the 1950s of people who were saying the CIA has brothel where they're drugging people people are like you're fing crazy like what's wrong with you 25 years later you're like oh actually Not only was he totally right it's way crazier than you could have ever imagined if I had told somebody in the street in America the CIA wanted to blow up Castro with the cigar I they would have said you are out of your mind or make his beard fall or yeah that's true these are real this actually happened uh if I go back to the Spanish American war or whatever and I was like wait maybe it's America that blew up the USS main again hanged for treason never would have happened a 100 years later what do we know it's true or it's probably true so it's like I'm just saying for the incred incred incredulity and just the way that people think about like oh it's just taking a long time uh you know it's not that easy when the government wants to keep a secret especially a very very tightly held one you know here it's they can do it and it can take a qu Titanic efforts on behalf of the public to even you know inch forward to getting it that's all I would say we'll see yeah we'll see yeah I want to see it's going to take a while by the way Congress you know after this whole election nonsense is up let's get back and let's get to work hey uh Trump if he knows all this stuff like brother you're already in trouble with the law you may as well you're already in trouble for classified documents may as well just like let the people American people well if he becomes president he should just immediately you know sign all last well last time around he had Mike Pompeo in his ear famously especially about the JFK thing we're talking about this with Jefferson Morley and they're like oh you just can't let the public you know know any of this stuff and I think it's just look it is crazy Obama Trump I mean remember what Obama said he was like yeah you know it's uh he's like I he's like there's some things that are out there uh but it we couldn't release it to the public he said something along those lines John put I always talk about this who was the chief of staff to Bill Clinton in the White House huge UFO guy he tried for years to get the CIA and others to tell him about these programs and he was the white house chief of staff with Yankee white security clearance and they blocked him out completely so just evidence someone someone should ask Joe Biden about this and maybe his maybe his half cooked brain will not realize that he shouldn't be saying what he's they wouldn't even tell accidentally down Biden is the ideal president for them they're like oh what a joke you know it's like in the UK they have joke called Yes Minister where the Deep State basically over there just jokes that the you know whoever's in this Yokel who's in charge the political guy they're like forget about it we've seen 50 of them come and go so for them Biden is the ideal president in terms of who you can just Hoodwink the entire time all right thank you guys for indulging that um we will uh if there's any breaking news over the weekend we'll see you otherwise we'll see you all next week hey if you like that video hit the
